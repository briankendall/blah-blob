software, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose,
be it commercial, non-commercial, silly, serious, very serious, really quite
terribly serious, a bit less serious but still serious enough to underscore the
seriousness of it, dramatic, ephemeral, illogical, illegal so long as you let
us get in on the cut, in-school so long as you brought enough for the class,
intangible, irrevocable, and by any means.
