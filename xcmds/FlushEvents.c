/* Dirt simple XCMD that just calls FlushEvents to clear out all keyboard and mouse events. Great when paired with GetKeys or GetAnyKey XFCNs to stop any keystrokes entered when a script is running from piling up and all firing off on the next idle cycle.*/#include "HyperXCmd.h"pascal void main(XCmdPtr paramPtr){	FlushEvents(mDownMask | mUpMask | keyDownMask | keyUpMask | autoKeyMask, 0);}
